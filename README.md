## Project Discription
# Image Feature Extraction with ResNet50

üöÄ **Exciting News: Unleashing the Power of Machine Learning!** üåü

Thrilled to share a recent project where I harnessed the capabilities of deep learning to extract image features using a ResNet50 model. üñºÔ∏è‚ú®

## What's Inside:

- Leveraged TensorFlow and Keras to build a powerful image feature extraction pipeline.
- Utilized the ResNet50 architecture to capture intricate details from images.
- Ensured efficiency and scalability by incorporating a GlobalMaxPool2D layer.

## Key Insights:

- The extracted features serve as a robust foundation for various machine learning applications.
- Achieved seamless integration with the fashion dataset, enabling scalable feature extraction.

## Results & Impact:

- Successfully processed a diverse set of images from the fashion dataset.

### For app.py
* Loads a pre-trained ResNet50 model with ImageNet weights.
* Creates a new model with the ResNet50 base and a GlobalMaxPool2D layer.
* Defines a function to extract normalized features from an image using the ResNet50 model.
* Iterates through image files in the "fashion-dataset/images" directory, extracts features, and stores them in a feature list.
* Saves the feature list and file names using the Pickle module.

### For main.py
* In main.py is uses for backend as for website
* BE carefull About file path
